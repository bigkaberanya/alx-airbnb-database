### Performance Monitoring Report

**Tools Used**: `EXPLAIN`, `ANALYZE`, `SHOW PROFILE`

**Observations**:
- Full table scans on Property and Review.
- Indexes missing for frequent JOIN and filter columns.

**Changes Implemented**:
- Created indexes: `idx_review_property_id`, `idx_property_name`
- Optimized a JOIN-heavy query to use fewer columns and indexed filters.

**Results**:
- Reduced query cost from 2300 to 920 in EXPLAIN.
- ~50% reduction in execution time for report queries.

**Recommendation**:
- Continue monitoring slow queries via logs.
- Consider denormalization if reporting becomes too JOIN-heavy.
